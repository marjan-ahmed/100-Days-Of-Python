# Write a python program to translate a message into secret code language. Use the rules below to translate normal English into secret code language

# Coding:
if the word contains atleast 3 characters, remove the first letter and append it at the end
now append three random characters at the starting and the end
else:
simply reverse the string

## Decoding:
if the word contains less than 3 characters, reverse it
else:
remove 3 random characters from start and end. Now remove the last letter and append it to the beginning

# Note:
Your program should ask whether you want to code or decode
